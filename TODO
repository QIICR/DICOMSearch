from Andrey:
* make indexing more intelligent, handle punctuation
* look into indexing errors
* play with it on more components of the standard
* handle <a> in #dicomText so that the destination URL is loaded in the same div
 * improve presentation, add QIICR logo
 * dicom.css referenced from the standard text is not found

from Steve:
* handle pairs/combinations of words (AF: check out Lucene)
* generate tree of the content

from David:
* add an option to search only in certain parts of the standard
* consult with the DICOM WG6 before making the resource public to solicit input from a smaller group of experts
